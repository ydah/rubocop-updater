# rubocop-updater

[Custom action](https://docs.github.com/en//actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions)
to update [RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) and regenerate `.rubocop_todo.yml`
to exclude all newly added offense cops and create Pull Request.

If you are developing a Rails project, such as those listed below, we may be able to help you.

* [x] It's a reasonably large Rails project
* [x] [Enabling pending Cops in bulk](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/versioning.html#enablingdisabling-pending-cops-in-bulk)
* [x] Many todo's remain in `.rubocop_todo.yml`.

This updater provides you with the automation of creating a PR for your upgrade that is secure and easy to see the differences.

Create a PR by creating a commit as follows:

* bundle exec rubocop --auto-gen-config (for once you have `.rubocop_todo.yml` cleanup)
* bundle update --conservative rubocop
* bundle exec rubocop --auto-gen-config
